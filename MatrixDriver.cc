	This is where all the test data will exist. Systems of input still need to be set up, but for now, this will have to do.
		It should be mentioned that a special function will be present to properly construct the objects given these inputs.
		For the time being, the test code and variables will be constructed as follows: A + B = C.
		This doesn't take into account anything regarding subtraction (yet), but in the future it may be wise to set up a file that randomly generates input and separately calculates the output for comparison for each matrix operation/function respectively.
		Solutions to this issue will be explored in the future, and this section of comments may be moved to the readme.md file.
